I am lazy and like using Git in Powershell. Here are a few functions that I load into my Powershell profile to make life a little easier. (Also, I have been using this for years and needed somewhere easily accessible to store it).

I hope this brings you as much joy as it did me over the last while :)  

## How to use
Setup is really easy. You will need to load these functions into your Powershell profile. To do this, follow these simple steps:
- Launch Powershell
- We'll need to find the location of the current profile being used by Powershell, run the following command:
 `$Profile`
 - You will then get the location of your profile - open the file
 - Select the functions you want from [here](https://github.com/mr-kg/Git.Powershell.Shortcuts/blob/main/profile.ps1) 
 - Simply copy/paste into your Powershell profile, save it and reload Powershell!
 - Call the name of any function in your Powershell session (`pom`, `nb "name"`, `push "message"` etc)
